# useful-numeric-math-scripts
Useful Python Scripts for Numerical Mathematics. This project was created in order to keep track of different important 
mathematical functions or methods which are taught in 'H√∂here Mathematik f√ºr Informatiker 1' (Higher Mathematics for
Computer Scientists 1).

# üôè Participate (for invited collaborators)
1. Choose one of the learned Mathematical Methods and write a script for it. If your method requires more than one 
script, put them in a corresponding folder.
2. If the method you want to write already exists in the repository, but you want to write an improved version of it,
continue as follows:
   1. Create a corresponding branch and work on your own implementation on there.
   2. Create a pull request and request review from other collaborators.
   3. We check out the improved solution and if agreed by all, add it to the collection or replace the older one with it.
